## Project Name:  Tax Bracket Calculator Application

### Course Title:
Web Application Development

### Assignment Date:  
February 24, 2018

### Student Name:  
Cole Sheridan

### Project Description:
This assignment builds on lessons learned from the previous assignment, by asking students to create if/else statemebts in the javascript code to create a tax calculator that computes a person's taxes and their tax bracket depending on their income and status.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. There are three types of loop statements, a while loop, a do/while loop, and a for loop.  A while loop is a pre-check loop that determines the truth value of a given condition before executing the loop, and continues to execute the loop until the condition is false.  If the condition is not true before running the loop one time, and the loop is a while loop, then the loop will not be executed by the program.  A do/while loop is a post-check loop that executes the code in the loop before checking the truth value of a determined condition and starting a new iteration of the loop (or not).  A do/while loop will execute at least once, even if the condition is false when the program first reaches the loop.  A for loop is often used when you know exactly how many times you want the loop to execute, as you define the parameters, conditions, and incriment on the same line you declare the loop.
2. An array is a complex data type that can store multiple values under a single variable name.  An array is declared using "var arrayName = [element1, element2, etc];"  Each data piece in the array is called an element, and arrays do not need to contain elemts of a single data type.  You can access an elemt in an array by using "arrayName[x]" where x is the index of the elemt you are trying to access.  The first piece of data will be at index 0, the second piece at index 1, the third at index 2, and so on.  You can determine the length of an array using the length function, which is simply "arrayName.length;" and returns only the length of the array, not the values inside.
3. If/else and swtich statements are similar, but not the same.  An if/else statement determines the truth value of a condition, and executes the code within the statement if and only if the condition is true.  If the condition is not true, the code is not executed, and the if/else statement moves on to the next condition (signified by and else if or an else), and executes the code for that condition if and only if it is true.  An else statement with no condition will execute if and only if none of the if/else if conditions evaluated to be true.  An if/else statement will only execute one condition in a program, making it impossible to execute two seperate codes for two seperate conditions in the if/else statement.  A switch statement, on the other hand, determines the truth value of a condition on a case basis, and will execute the code following the first case in which the condition is true.  You can prevent a switch statement from executing mulitple cases by placing a break statement at the end of each case, causing the program to break out of the switch statement after executing a case within.  For a switch statement, a default case is used (simply called default) if you want a code that runs should none of the cases be evaluated as true.
